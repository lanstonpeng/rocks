### Daily Retrospection

#### What you've done

#### What you've learned
- How the component platform works
	- But you can't always stand on this level
		- Why it should be so
		- How it can be designed better

#### Things were done well
- Sleep for a while


#### What I Found
- At the very first beginning,I was able to handle to complexity by divide them into parts and set their priority But while tons of interruption came in ,it seems that I lost my control ,doing things like a broken priority queue
- Context Saving 
	- while being interrupted,try to save the current context
	
- keep that sprint stuff in mind
