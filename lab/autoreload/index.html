  Using Parenthesized Substring Matches

  Including parentheses in a regular expression pattern causes the corresponding submatch to be remembered. For example, /a(b)c/ matches the characters 'abc' and remembers 'b'. To recall these parenthesized substring matches, use the Array elements [1], ..., [n].

  The number of possible parenthesized substrings is unlimited. The returned array holds all that were found. The following examples illustrate how to use parenthesized substring matches.

  Example 1

  The following script uses the replace() method to switch the words in the string. For the replacement text, the script uses the $1 and $2 in the replacement to denote the first and second parenthesized substring matches.

  var re = /(\w+)\s(\w+)/;
  var str = "John Smith";
  var newstr = str.replace(re, "$2, $1");
  console.log(newstr);
